                Our paths crossed on a rainy autumn evening at a cozy coffee shop in San Francisco.
                Sarah was reading her favorite book, and James accidentally spilled his coffee on her
                table. What started as an awkward apology turned into hours of conversation.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Three years later, James took Sarah back to that same coffee shop. As they sat at their
                favorite corner table, he got down on one knee and asked her to spend forever with him.
                Through happy tears, she said yes.
